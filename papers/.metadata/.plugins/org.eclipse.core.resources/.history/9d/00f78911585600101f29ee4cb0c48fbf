\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  \begin{description}
  \item[a]Date of first release of the language.
  \item[b]Name of designer or designers.
  \item[c]Is the actual language version you are using the original version? an extension of it? a subset of it? neither an
extension nor a subset but a version based on the original language? Explain your answer.
  \item[d]If not the original version, state the date of the release of the version you are using, as well as the date of the
release of the translator (compiler, interpreter) you are using to write programs.
  \item[e]Do the language have an standard? if so, state release date, and state whether the translator you are using imple-
ments the standard.
  \item[f]If the language does not have a standard,
  \begin{description}
  \item[i]list the documents you are using for the release you are using.
  \item[ii]how do all the 3 different main language users (language designers,
  language implementors, and programmers) deal with the understanding of the language features and their semantics without a standard?
  \end{description}
  \item[g]What programming paradigms does the language support? How well does it
  support each paradigm? Clearly support your answers with language features.
