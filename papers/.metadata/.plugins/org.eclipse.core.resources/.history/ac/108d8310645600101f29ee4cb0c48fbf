\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  \begin{description}
  \item[a]Date of \textbf{first} release of the language.\\
  \\
  According to \cite{krasner:bits_of_history}, Smalltalk-80 system has its roots in the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center starting more than 10 years ago. Because of publishing book in 1982,
first release of Smalltalk is in 1972 (Smalltalk-72). Some others sources
pointed to year 1971.
  \item[b]Name of designer or designers.\\
  \\
  As presented in \cite{wiki:smalltalk}, designers of language are Alan Kay, Dan
  Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace.
  \item[c]Is the actual language version you are using the original version? an extension of it? a subset of it? neither an
extension nor a subset but a version based on the original language? Explain your answer.
  \item[d]If not the original version, state the date of the release of the version you are using, as well as the date of the
release of the translator (compiler, interpreter) you are using to write programs.
  \item[e]Do the language have an standard? if so, state release date, and state whether the translator you are using implements the standard.
  \item[f]If the language does not have a standard,
  \begin{description}
  \item[i]list the documents you are using for the release you are using.
  \item[ii]how do all the 3 different main language users (language designers,
  language implementors, and programmers) deal with the understanding of the language features and their semantics without a standard?
  \end{description}
  \item[g]What programming paradigms does the language support? How well does it
  support each paradigm? Clearly support your answers with language features.
  \end{description}
  \item
  \begin{description}
  \item[a]Describe the component(s) for the formation of an executable program, i.e. what do you need to write a complete
program that can be executed?
  \item[b]What language constructs are used for the formation of library units?
  \end{description}
  \item
  \begin{description}
  \item[a]Evaluate the language in terms of \textit{readability, writeability and
  reliability}.
  \item[b]Is it an all-purpose language (sufficiently general)? Support your answer with the existence or lack of language constructs.
  \end{description}
  \item Give 3 example programs:\\
For the programs you are asked below, avoid writing one page type programs that fail to show the power of the language.
  \begin{description}
  \item[a]One that you can steal, but can also read, understand and explain. Produce an example of its execution (give its
input and output.). State clearly the input used in the execution and the output produced.
  \item[b]Write one that is 'representative' of the language application area.
  Make it a meaningful program.
  \item[c]To be announced shortly.
  \end{description}
